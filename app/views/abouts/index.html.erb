      <p class="about-content about-content-second">
        We are Elsie and Dominika, founders and clean beauty lovers. When we went from reading food labels to reading our beauty product labels, we were pretty disappointed and occasionally horrified. We decided to make a change.

    <h1 class="about-us-header">Why do we make products?</h1>
    <p class="about-content">
    We love beauty products but we also love our skin, our health and wellbeing. Going clean means that we know what we're putting on our bodies, as well as in. We're not wasting our money on cheap alternatives; we're actually nourishing our skin and hair with high quantities of our favourite plants, nuts, flowers and seeds - all the anti-ageing, super-moisturising, ultra-nourishing goodness that hasnâ€™t been diluted with pointless fillers and chemicals.
